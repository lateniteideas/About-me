              <h3 class="txt__imp">
                And why illustration, graphic design and web development?
              </h3>
              <p class="txt">
                Since childhood, Marc showed interest in traditional
                illustration. Everything was fine until, in his teens, he
                discovered digital art and never again took a brush.
                <br />
                <br />
                He started making fan made posters of his favorite movies even
                without knowing that other people were getting paid for doing
                that kind of things. Marc studied graphic design, he fell in
                love with this world and immersed himself in it for years. He
                created Lateniteideas and materialized all the ideas that were
                on his mind.
                <br />
                <br />
                Years later he discovered the web development and, as he says,
                he felt this love again.
                <span class="italic"> Hooray for tech!</span>, Marc adds.
              </p>

              <p class="txt">
                Well, -no one expects that, wait for it-, he loves to draw. He
                could work for 15 hours straight but, in his free time, he still
                wants to draw.
                <br />
                <br />
                He also loves to exercise, play basketball, watch TV shows and
                movies and, as much as the next guy, having a beer with his
                friends.
